# GitHub Actions Workflow for Deploying Backend API
#
# This workflow automates the deployment of the backend API to a remote server.
# It is triggered on pushes to the 'main' branch that involve changes within the 'backend/' directory.
# Crucially, it excludes server-specific configuration files like '.env' and 'config.php' from the synchronization process.
